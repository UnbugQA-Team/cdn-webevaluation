# Dynamic URL Change Observer

This repository hosts a JavaScript script that monitors changes to the URL and sends notifications to a parent window using the `postMessage` function. It can be used to track URL changes and communicate them across different domains.

## Usage

1. Include the script in your HTML:

   ```html
   <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/UnbugQA-Team/cdn-webevaluation@main/script.js"></script>
